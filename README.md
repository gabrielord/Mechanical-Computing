# Solving Differential Equations with Discretization in Mechanical Computing

This project focuses on solving differential equations using discretization techniques in mechanical computing. By discretizing the continuous problem into a discrete form, numerical methods are applied to approximate the solution. The project utilizes Python libraries for numerical computation, visualization, and data analysis.

## Overview

The project involves discretizing differential equations and solving them using numerical methods implemented in Python. Discretization allows the conversion of continuous differential equations into algebraic equations that can be solved iteratively. The solutions obtained provide insights into the behavior of the system described by the differential equations.

## Libraries Used

The project makes use of the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: A library for numerical computing in Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
- `seaborn`: A data visualization library based on matplotlib, offering a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: A plotting library for creating visualizations in Python, allowing for the creation of various types of plots and charts.
- `matplotlib.colors`: A module providing classes and functions for working with colors in matplotlib plots.
- `pandas`: A data manipulation and analysis library in Python, offering data structures and operations for working with structured data.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy seaborn matplotlib pandas
